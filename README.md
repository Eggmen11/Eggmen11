# Yo, Iâ€™m Egi

Whatâ€™s good? Iâ€™m the dude whoâ€™s always got a laptop, a football, or a barbell in handâ€”sometimes all three if Iâ€™m feeling extra. I live for coding dope stuff, smashing it on the pitch, and lifting heavy things just to flex on gravity. Lifeâ€™s a game, and Iâ€™m here to win it.

## What Iâ€™m Up To

Right now, Iâ€™m knee-deep in the wild world of AI agents. Iâ€™m building some slick LangGraph agentsâ€”think of â€˜em as my digital crew thatâ€™s got my back. Iâ€™m soaking up everything I can about agents, from how they think to how they donâ€™t completely screw up (yet). Itâ€™s a grind, but Iâ€™m loving the chaos.

## The Vibes

- **Coding**: My keyboardâ€™s my weapon, and Iâ€™m crafting i don't even know what but you bet it is cool.
- **Football**: Dribbling past defenders or coding a script â€” same energy, just sweatier.
- **Lifting**: PRs in the gym, PRs in my repos. Gains all day.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m just getting started. More agents, more code, more goalsâ€”on and off the field. Stick around if youâ€™re into the madnessâ€”Iâ€™ve got big plans and bigger lifts coming.
