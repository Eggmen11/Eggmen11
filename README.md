# Yo, I’m Egi 💪

What’s good? I’m the dude who’s always got a laptop 💻, a football ⚽, or a barbell 🏋️ in hand—sometimes all three if I’m feeling extra. I live for coding dope stuff, hitting top bins, and lifting heavy things just to flex on gravity. Life’s a game, and I’m here to win it 🏆.

## What I’m Up To 🔥

Right now, I’m knee-deep in the wild world of AI agents 🤖. I’m building some slick LangGraph agents—think of ‘em as my digital crew that’s got my back. I’m soaking up everything I can about agents, from how they think to how they don’t completely screw up (yet). It’s a grind, but I’m loving the chaos 🌩️.

## The Vibes ✨

- **Coding** 💾: My keyboard’s my weapon, and I’m crafting i don't even know what but you bet it is cool.
- **Football** ⚽: Dribbling past defenders or coding a script — same energy, just sweatier 💦.
- **Lifting** 🏋️‍♂️: PRs in the gym, PRs in my repos. Gains all day 💪.

## What’s Next? 🚀

I’m just getting started. More agents, more code, more goals—on and off the field. Stick around if you’re into the madness—I’ve got big plans and bigger lifts coming ⏳.
